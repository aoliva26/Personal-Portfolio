            My name is August, but I go by Gus, and I am a second year transfer student studying architecture after <br>
            transfering from the University at Buffalo after my freshman year where I was a finance major. I am from Staten <br>
            Island, NY and I commute to NJIT each day. Outside of school I currently intern at an architecture firm two days <br>
            a week where I have worked at since February of 2021 whenever I wasn't at college in Buffalo. For fun I enjoy playing <br>
            sports such as basketball and football as well as watching my favorite sports teams, the Yankees, Steelers and Penguins. <br>
            I also enjoy listening to music and practicing graphic design in my free time. <br>
